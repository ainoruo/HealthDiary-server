        <h3>What is HealthDiary?</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to HealthDiary - your personal health journal to help you
          track and maintain your well-being on a daily basis. HealthDiary
          provides a convenient and user-friendly way to record and monitor
          information related to your health, such as exercise, nutrition, heart
          rate variability (HRV), and medication.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exercise: Record your daily physical activities, such as runs, gym
          workouts, and other physical activities. You can note the duration,
          intensity, and exercises performed. By tracking your exercise habits,
          you can motivate yourself to stay active and set goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nutrition: Keep track of your daily diet and eating habits. Record the
          foods you eat and their quantities, as well as any special diets or
          food allergies. Monitoring your nutrition helps you make healthy food
          choices and ensure adequate nutrient intake.
        </p>

        <p>
          HRV Values: Monitor and record your heart rate variability (HRV)
          values daily. HRV values provide information about the function of the
          autonomic nervous system and your body's stress level. Tracking helps
          you identify stress triggers and learn relaxation techniques to
          improve stress management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Medication: Record the medications you take and their dosages. Keep
          track of the times you take medication and any potential side effects.
          Regular medication monitoring ensures that you follow your doctor's
          instructions and achieve the best possible treatment outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          HealthDiary offers you the opportunity to monitor your health
          comprehensively and make informed choices to promote your well-being.
          Be proactive about your health and use HealthDiary as a tool on your
          journey towards a healthier and happier life!
