        <h2>Welcome to HealthDiary!</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to HealthDiary - your personal health journal to help you
          track and maintain your well-being on a daily basis. HealthDiary
          provides a convenient and user-friendly way to record and monitor
          information related to your health, such as exercise, nutrition, heart
          rate variability (HRV), and medication. Exercise: Record your daily
          physical activities, such as runs, gym workouts, and other physical
          activities. You can note the duration, intensity, and exercises
          performed. By tracking your exercise habits, you can motivate yourself
          to stay active and set goals. Nutrition: Keep track of your daily diet
          and eating habits. Record the foods you eat and their quantities, as
          well as any special diets or food allergies. Monitoring your nutrition
          helps you make healthy food choices and ensure adequate nutrient
          intake. HRV Values: Monitor and record your heart rate variability
          (HRV) values daily. HRV values provide information about the function
          of the autonomic nervous system and your body's stress level. Tracking
          helps you identify stress triggers and learn relaxation techniques to
          improve stress management. Medication: Record the medications you take
          and their dosages. Keep track of the times you take medication and any
          potential side effects. Regular medication monitoring ensures that you
          follow your doctor's instructions and achieve the best possible
          treatment outcomes. HealthDiary offers you the opportunity to monitor
          your health comprehensively and make informed choices to promote your
          well-being. Be proactive about your health and use HealthDiary as a
          tool on your journey towards a healthier and happier life!
